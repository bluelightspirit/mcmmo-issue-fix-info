# mcmmo-issue-fix-info
This is a repository to show that I helped fix a bug on an open-source software called McMMO back in 2016, by reporting an issue relating to efficiency 6+ being removed whenever smelting or anviling was done. I tracked down the issue to McMMO despite just being a Minecraft player as I enjoy dealing with Minecraft plugins.
